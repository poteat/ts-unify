# BuilderUtilities

## Overview

`BuilderUtilities` packages typed helper members that live alongside builders on
the `U` namespace. These utilities are not tied to a specific AST kind; they
improve ergonomics when composing fluent helpers.

## Members

- Provider‑scoped utility members that support composition with fluent helpers.
  Specific utilities are documented in their respective provider specs.

## Scope

- Provider for the `U` namespace’s helper surface. Concrete helper semantics are
  defined in their own files and re‑exposed here via types.
